# Enclave Runtime Dependencies Installer

The Enclave runtime depends on the following packages:

- runit
- ifconfig
- iptables
- iproute2

Typically, these would be installed using a package manager like `apk` or `apt-get`. However, to allow Enclave builds to be reproducible we cannot use these package managers. Installing dependencies using a package manager generates internal files which throw off the reproducible builds by including things like timestamps (such as the scripts tar file generated by apk).

To get around using the package managers, we need our own consistent installer for the runtime's dependencies. To make it consistent, the CLI will pull a pinned version of the installer (guaranteeing the tar file's timestamps won't change).

The archive includes precompiled binaries of the runtimes dependencies. These binaries are built in a container defined in `Dockerfile` which outputs the binaries and an installer script in an archive.

## Testing

The binaries and installer can be tested by building `test.Dockerfile`, and running the commands: runit, ifconfig

```
# Build the installer
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t build-installer .

# Run the installer with volume attached to local dir
docker run --platform=linux/amd64 -v output:/output build-installer
    
# Build the test docker file
docker build -f test.Dockerfile -t installer-test .

# Run the docker file with command to check dependency has been properly installed
docker run installer-test iptables -v
```
